Overview
MyToken is an ERC20-compliant token built on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages OpenZeppelin's well-established libraries to include additional features such as burning, pausing, and ownership control.

This smart contract implements the following features:

Minting: The ability for the owner to create new tokens.
Burning: The ability for token holders to destroy their tokens, reducing the total supply.
Pausing: The owner can pause all token transfers, in case of an emergency.
Ownership: Ownership of the contract can be transferred, allowing for administrative control.
